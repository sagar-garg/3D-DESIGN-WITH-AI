 AI-Assisted-3D-Design

Setup

There are two different environments used.
1. nlp-env for part 1 and 3 [environment file](AI-Assisted-3D-Design-Optimization/environment.yml)
2. point-e-env for part 2 [requirements file](point-e/requirements.txt). However, this repository is a clone of OpenAI's point-e project (https://github.com/openai/point-e), and the suggested [setup](point-e/setup.py) method is through pip install -e .


Codes of Concern

[Step 1](AI-Assisted-3D-Design-Optimization/step1.ipynb)

[Step 2 part 1](point-e/point_e/scripts/text2pointcloud.ipynb)
[Step 2 part 2](point-e/point_e/scripts/pointcloud2mesh.ipynb)

[Step 3 Unfinished](AI-Assisted-3D-Design-Optimization/step3.ipynb)


Notes

I have not committed big model files (such as text2pointcloud), and virtual environments (such as point-e-env) due to Github upload limits
